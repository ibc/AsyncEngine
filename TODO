"Memory leak" in _uv_prepare_signals
------------------------------------

uv_prepare_t *_uv_prepare_signals is memory allocated (with ALLOC) but is never freed, how to do that? should I do that when uv_run ends? really useful?

Basically, this leaks:

  loop do AE.start {} end

Does it make sense to expect that to occur??
